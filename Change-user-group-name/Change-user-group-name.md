# Change User name & Group name

The default user name and group name of Raspberry Pi is pi. If you don't like it, surely you can customize it.

By running the command ``sudo usermod -l new_user pi``, you can change your user name. (``new_user`` is a placeholder, you can change it to the name you want)

Similarly, by running the command ``sudo groupmod -n new_group pi``, you can change your group name. (``new_group`` is also a placeholder, you can change it to the name you want)

By the way, the default password of Raspberry Pi is ``raspberry``, you can change it by simply running the command ``passwd`` and follow its instructions.
